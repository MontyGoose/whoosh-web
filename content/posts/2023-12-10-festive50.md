Hello!

I am riding 50kms on the Herne Hill Velodrome which is 112 laps!  I aim to do this is less than 2 hours 15 minutes!

## When

Thursday 27th December - from 10am to 12:15.

## Where

Herne Hill Velodrome.

## Why

This is to raise money to support the HHV Youth Development's outreach work, enabling more young people to access cycling in South London.

 I think that riding and track cycling are goods skills for everyone to have. It has taught me to communicate with others more effectively, increased my awareness and alertness to situations around me, and has made me fitter and it is a good way to step out of your comfort zone in a safe and supported environment.

I think that raising money to help people who otherwise can’t access the velodrome is a fantastic thing that we should do more of. A school going to the velodrome is a great way of children getting out of the classroom getting exercise and fresh air. It allows people who don’t interact with each other to make friends with a cross section of people.

All in all, riding at the velodrome is so much fun, and I would love the opportunity to undertake this challenge and raise money to allow others to have the experiences I have. Children should all have this opportunity to ride at the velodrome

## What!!

This is a huge challenge for me, 50 kms is a long way and 112 laps is a daunting task for an 11 year old and to do this under a time limit means I need to ride at an average of 22.5kph.

I hope you can sponsor me using the link [Fundraiser - Youth Festive 50 (kms) Fundraising Page (fhhv.cc)](https://supportus.fhhv.cc/fundraising/youth-track-festive-50-fundraising-page) or QR code

And if you can come and cheer me that would be excellent

Bene
