subtitle: Whoosh started something like this.
---
It started as an idle discussion doing a long bike ride
through Wales one day, inspired by the opening
of Sustrans Route 8 in 1995. I don’t think any
of us had cycled very far before then. The most
some done was two or three London to Brighton
one-day rides in the 1980s.

 By 2002  knees
were feeling a bit dodgy and we had no idea if
they would last more than a day on a bike. A
longer ride may have been no more than mid-
life dreaming.


Then at a St Saviour’s School fair in 2002 we saw the
Headteacher, sitting behind
a model of the new school hall which was to be
built near the infant block. All around him were
posters outlining the plans and the fundraising
needed from the community. A light bulb
moment: why not do that ride through Wales to
raise some money?


Our idle idea had come alive. 

## 
**The name**


I can’t recall the precise chronology, but it was
Jim whose creative mind came up a short time
after the school fair with the name WHOOSH:


**W**elsh **H**ills; bike wheels **OO**; **S**chool **H**all


Obvious when you think of it but such a great
cycling idea that 18 years later the same
treatment appears on the shirt of the winner of
the Tour de France!
