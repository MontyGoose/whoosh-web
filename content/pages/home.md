      THE WHOOSHING TREE 

       ROOTS 

      I reckon the tree we planted had some strong healthy roots which was the strong friendship group in the Parish of Herne Hill, at St Saviours and St Pauls, with plenty of laterals heading into other communities. This group was physically fit from regular cycling – many bike commuting for years. It was also vari-talented, and vari-faceted – a good balance of leaders and followers, thinkers and doers. 


      SOIL 


      Strong roots had fertile cycling soil. Herne Hill had a strong cycling culture due to the Velodrome. In the noughties Sustrans was on a rising curve as national standard-bearer for recreational cycling. Lottery funding for the Millennium had triggered new long-distance routes and improvements to existing ones. Cycling was increasingly part of UK sporting identity. Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins were emerging as international stars headed for 2004 Olympic success. And we all know what has happened since!


      NUTRIENTS 


      The bigger a tree gets the more it needs. New recruits from the parish and beyond have enriched our soil and fed our tree with new interests and skills. Time trials. Singing. Woodland visits. History talks. Fancy dress. All nourish our tree in different ways. 


      BLOSSOM AND FRUIT 


      So, our tree has been healthy and yielded a good harvest, year on year: money for good causes; deeper relationships; stronger legs and hearts (I hope!) We pick the fruit; we share it and then long for next year to do it all over again. More people join us each year. We share the blessing; they enrich the crop.
