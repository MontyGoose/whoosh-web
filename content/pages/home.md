  ## Hello and welcome to Whoosh!


  There is not one story! There is not even one

  story of a given day of a given ride. We split up.

  We get lost. We have bad days and good days

  but not always on the same days as everyone

  elseâ€™s good or bad days.   



  Everyone experiences

  Whoosh differently - but perhaps this website will give you a glimpse of what Whoosh is all about.
