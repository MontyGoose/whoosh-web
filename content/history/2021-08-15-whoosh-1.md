      We cycled every mile of (correction, every inch of) National Cycle Route 8
      (aka Lon Las Cymru) from Cardiff to Holyhead. 


      Over 250 miles in four days. 


      ### Friday 9 May


      Cardiff Bay to Brecon (Tyâ€™n-y-Caeau Youth Hostel, Groesffordd)

       64 miles, 0000 ascent; following the Taff Trail from Cardiff to Merthyr Tydfill then minor roads and forest tracks past large reservoirs to our hostel just outside Brecon 

      ### Saturday 10 May


      Brecon to Trefeglwys,Nr Llanidloes 


      70 miles, 0000 ascent, mostly riding up the Wye Valley into the centre of Wales, through increasingly rugged landscape. 


      ### Sunday 11 May


      Llanidloes to Dolbenmaen Nr Porthmadog


      74 miles, 0000 feet ascent; initially along the upper Severn Valley climbing to the highest point of the ride 1,673 feet near Bryn y Fedwen; then whooshing down through Machynlleth towards the Irish Sea. 


      ### Monday 12 May


      Dolbenmaen to Holyhead Station 


      63 miles, 0000 ascent; across the Llyn Peninsular via Criccieth to Caernarfon; across the Menai Straits; then a wind-resisted slog across Anglesey to Holyhead Station
