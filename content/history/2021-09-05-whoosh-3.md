      ## Bristol to Land’s End

      ## Into the wind


      Whoosh 2 had proved harder than any of us really expected or wanted

      and we moderated our expectations for Whoosh 3. We planned a total

      mileage of 300 – averaging 60 a day. We were broadly following NCN

      Route 3 from Bristol to Land’s End, but we made two major detours to get

      to our nights 1 and 3 YHA accommodation which were both well worth it.

      Although they added some extra hills, they saved us some miles.


      ### Friday 13 May Bristol Temple Meads to Crowcombe YHA


      73 miles; 0000 ascent. Route 3 follows quiet country lanes into the Mendips

      where we had spectacular views towards Glastonbury Tor followed by a wind

      assisted whoosh down into Wells. Lunch in Glastonbury, then west across the

      Somerset Levels. We left Route 3 at Bridgwater and followed our own route,

      on country lanes, over the spectacular Quantock Hills towards Crowcombe

      which nestles on the other side.


      ### Saturday 14 May Crowcombe YHA to Barnstable B&B


      50 miles; 0000 ascent. A much shorter day (in fact, the shortest Whoosh day

      yet!) We devised our own route over Brendon Hill to get back to Route 3 and

      our coffee break at Dulverton. We then crossed Exmoor on a wild afternoon

      looking for a lunch spot, reaching the highest point of the ride (483m at Fyl-

      don Common), followed by an effortless glide off Exmoor into Barnstable. We

      arrived in time for afternoon tea. A rare privilege.


      ### Sunday 15 May Barnstable to Tintagel YHA


      70 miles; 0000 ascent. A day of two halves! The morning was mostly flat on

      car-free bike routes along the Taw Estuary, then the Tarka Trail. The afternoon

      took us a switchback ride along the north Cornwall coast southwards from

      Bude. The map had plenty of double chevrons denoting short sharp hills. We

      left the signposted Route 3 mid-afternoon when it headed inland and stayed

      near the coast for more hills and spectacular views through Crackington Hav-

      en and Boscastle to Tintagel.


      ### Monday 16 May Tintagel YHA to Truro B&B


      67 miles; 0000 ascent. Another day of contrasts – repeating Sunday’s pattern

      – a flat morning followed by a hilly afternoon. We re-joined route 3 near to

      Camelford and crossed Bodmin Moor on a very calm morning. We then left

      Route 3 again and took the Route 32 detour along the wonderful Camel Trail

      bike route which hugs the scenic Camel Estuary. After a sun-baked lunch in

      Padstow our afternoon was spent on a clammy slog through inland Cornwall

      towards Truro.


      ### Tuesday 17 May Truro to Land’s End


      50 miles; 0000 ascent. This was our race to the sea, against the

      wind. Route 3 sped us through depressed post-industrial Cornwall

      (Redruth and Camborne) arriving on the south coast at St Michael’s

      Mount. We were running late so we missed out the slow coast hug-

      ging alternative via Mousehole, instead taking the direct line along

      the B3315 to get to Land’s End by mid-afternoon.
