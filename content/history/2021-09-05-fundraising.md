  Fundraising has always been a worthwhile side product
  of Whoosh, not its raison d’etre. We have
  chosen our charities carefully.

      Whoosh was born as a fundraising venture: the

      reason we first cycled across Wales in 2003

      was to raise money to build a new hall for St

      Saviour’s School. And in subsequent years we

      have continued to raise a lot of money for a

      range of good causes.


      The question we get asked most often is ‘how

      much money has Whoosh raised?’ I wish there was a simple and reliable answer. That would be

      neat wouldn’t it, but the truth is that we were not

      totally systematic over the years in recording all

      our fundraising results. However, we've done our best to unearth,

      and bring together, all the information I can

      from old spreadsheets, e-mails, letters, and our

      legacy charity websites. The results are in the

      table below.
